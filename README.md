My Second Front End Web Development Degree

## Areas of Interest
Attempted some clip paths for the intro-img. And shape outside.
Added some rainbow hover link attributes for fun.

## Struggles
Forgot a basic thing such as css/styles.css to link the css stylsheet path. Forgot css/.

Was struggling to make my columns adjust with media queries. Forgot about the calc function. Instead I was trying to give different projects, seperate classes and float. WRONG. Didn't work :) Thank you calc function.
